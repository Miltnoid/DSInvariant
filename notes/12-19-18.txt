VPregen :: Code -> Formula -> TestCases -> Formula
(* Calls into PIE repeatedly while building up counterexamples *)




LoopInvGen :: Formula -> LoopCode -> Formula
LoopInvGen P (while E do C) Q
(* Want to generate I for while loop that suffices to prove
   {P} While E do C {Q}

To do this, LoopInvGen finds a formula I such that
I /\ ~E => Q
{I /\ E} C {E}
P       => I

First LoopInvGen finds a sufficient I such that I /\ ~E is strong enough to
prove Q

Next LoopInvGen makes I inductive

Finally LoopInvGen checks if I is sufficiently weak to be proven by P.
If I is not sufficiently weak, LoopInvGen adds an example that satisfies P but
does not satisfy I into the suite, and loops again.

In essence, the two calls to VPreGen make I stronger and stronger, and then if I
has been made too strong, a counterexample is added so VPreGen can't get overly
strong in that same way again.

G = {} (* Good tests set to empty *)
loop
  I = VPreGen([Assume ~E], Q, 
  while not {I /\ E} C {I} do
    I' = VPreGen([Assume I /\ E; C], I, G)
    I = I /\ I'
  cex = Valid(P => I)
  if cex == None then
    return I
  else
    G := G U LoopHeadStates(cex)




Ok, now go back to our Set implementation (that holds at most 2 elements).
This set has the following interface:

module Set =
sig
  type t
  val empty    :: t
  val insert   :: t -> int -> t
  val contains :: t -> int -> bool
  val delete   :: t -> int -> t
end

I naively moved the ideas of LoopInvGen into SetInvGen (so overly specified to
Set, just as a first step)

SetInvGen :: SetModule -> Formula -> Formula
SetInvGen S Q =
(*
Let Q be a formula we wish to prove about Set
(aka: forall x, forall s. lookup x (delete x s) = false)

S is the set module implementation

We wish to find a invariant I such that forall s in Set. I(s), and I(s) => Q(s).

To do this, SetInvGen finds a formula I such that
I(s) => Q(s)
I(s) => forall x. I(insert s x)
I(s) => forall x. I(delete s x)
I(empty)

Following the same pattern as LoopInvGen...
First SetInvGen finds a sufficient I such that I(s) is strong enough to prove
Q(s)

Next LoopInvGen makes I inductive by first strengthening it sufficiently that
I(s) => forall x. I(insert s x)
I(s) => forall x. I(delete s x)

Finally LoopInvGen checks if I is sufficiently weak to be true for empty.
If I is not sufficiently weak, LoopInvGen adds an example that is empty but
does not satisfy I into the suite, and loops again.

(Start seeing the issue?)
*)

G = {} (* Good tests set to empty *)
loop
  I = VPreGen([], Q)
  while not {I} [s = insert x s] {I} do
    I' = VPreGen([Assume I; s = S.insert x s], I, G)
    I = I /\ I'
  while not {I} [s = delete x s] {I} do
    I' = VPreGen([Assume I; s = S.delete x s], I, G)
    I = I /\ I'
  cex = Valid(I(S.empty))
  if cex == None then
    return I
  else
    G := G U LoopHeadStates(cex)



So, the big issue I can see is that the way we build up counterexamples is from
checking if the condition is too strong.  For us, however, we only build up one
counterexample from this: we only build up the counterexample "empty".

For LoopInvGen, counterexamples are added from all LoopHeadStates of the
initial, so in theory all counterexamples could be added.  Not so here, we only
add the initials, so our "Good" set will remain constantly at G = {S.empty}.

How will this manifest? Something like:
First loop I will just be Q or something like that, as we have no examples
Second loop, G = {empty}
I could be set to s = empty
In the second while loop, it will loop forever then.  The while loops terminate
in LoopInvGen because we add "the whole execution," but we do no such thing in
this version.

To me, this highlights two fundamental questions:
How do we generate counterexamples that are not just the initials
How do we safely refine I such that we don't get in an infinite loop.
